# Top-level Await in Typescript

This is a starter repo that enables you to start using top-level await in Typescript, and it's compatible and configured to work with Jest and Nodemon as well.
This example only includes the minimal configuration changes to show how to make this languge feature work. It doesn't include Express or Next.js or any other framework, just a Node example. This way you should be able to integrate the changes better in your existing project. Check my blog post [here](https://alinalihassan.com/blog/top-level-await-typescript) to read a walk-through.
